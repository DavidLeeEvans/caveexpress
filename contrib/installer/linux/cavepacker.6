.SH NAME
cavepacker \- Sokoban game
 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBcavepacker\fR [\fIoption\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcavepacker\fP CavePacker is a sokoban game.
Keep your cave tidy. To do this, make sure that all the spreaded packages are
put onto their targets. You can only push, pulling is not allowed.

You get higher ratings for lesser moves you need. The first few maps might be
easy to solve - but the more you progress in the game, the harder the maps
will be. 

There is also a multiplayer mode available.
